# Wallet Program

## Description

The wallet program is a rails application that allows you to
add and subtract items from your account via a text box.  All
you need to do is type in a credit (in a positive decimal format)
or a debit (in a negative decimal format) and the program will store
these values in a database.  Just click the home button for several
statistics including:

 * Total number of transactions
 * Amount spent for current and previous month
 * Number of transactions for current and previous month
 * Biggest expense of all time and for current month
